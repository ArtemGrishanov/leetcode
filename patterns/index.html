           Use queue for BFS traversal. For serialization.
           Use recursion to detect mirror trees.

            Best buy.
            Array of natural integers is given. Detect max revenue you can earn. Buy first, then sell.
            O(n). Like classic min search. But after each min update, we also update (currentPrice - min) as max.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some problems we need to sort data before algorythm, no options.
            Like in "wave array problem".
        </p>
        <p>
            n = 1 - n; // switches 0 and 1 in cycle
        </p>
        <p>
            n >> 1 == Math.floor(n / 2)
        </p>
        <p>
            You must implement binary search in JavaScript sometimes.
            Example binarySearch(ar, el, from, to, compare_fn);
            Function returns element index or -index to insert, if value not found.
        </p>

            Worst case balancing pattern.
            Example: Drop(Egg1) + Drop(Egg2) is always the same
        </p>
        <p>
            x+(x-1)+(x-2)+ ... +1 = x(x+1)/2
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes you dont need to find path, only sum. See /minimum-path-sum.html
            I concentrated on path finding.

            Iterative approach can be converted to recursive approach. And vice versa.
